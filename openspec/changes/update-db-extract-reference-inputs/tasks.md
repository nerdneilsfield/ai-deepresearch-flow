## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Add `--json` target input to `paper db extract`
- [x] 1.2 Make `--input-json` and `--input-bibtex` mutually exclusive reference inputs
- [x] 1.3 Default `--json` to `--input-json` when only reference JSON is provided
- [x] 1.4 Parse bibtex reference file and build filter set
- [x] 1.5 Filter target JSON by reference titles (normalize same as db serve)
- [x] 1.6 Include unmatched references in `--output-csv`
- [x] 1.7 Update README/README_ZH with examples
- [x] 1.8 Deduplicate extracted JSON entries by normalized title before writing output
- [x] 1.9 Keep the most detailed entry when multiple matches map to one reference
- [x] 1.10 Normalize BibTeX title formatting (LaTeX/math markers) during matching
- [x] 1.11 Add author/year fallback when title matching fails
- [x] 1.12 Include matched and only-in-A entries in CSV output for reference filtering
- [x] 1.13 Strip leading decimal section numbers in titles during matching
- [x] 1.14 Avoid merging numeric single-character tokens during title normalization
